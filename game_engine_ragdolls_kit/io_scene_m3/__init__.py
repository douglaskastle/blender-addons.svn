"""
This script imports m3 format files to Blender.

The m3 file format, used by Blizzard in several games, is based around the mdx and m2 file format.  Thanks to the efforts of Volcore, madyavic and the people working on libm3, the file format has been reversed engineered enough to make this script possible (Thanks guys!).

This script currently imports the following:
- Geometry data (vertices, faces, submeshes [in vertex groups])
- Model Textures (currently only the first material is supported)
   
    Blender supports the DDS file format and needs the image in the same
    directory.  This script will notify you of any missing textures.

TODO:
- Documentation & clean up
- Import *ALL* materials and bind accordingly
- Bind specular, normal, and emissive maps following new API
- Adjust vertices to bind pose (import IREF matrices)
- Import Armature data
- Get acquainted with 2.54 Armature API.
- Import Animation data

Known Bugs:
    Thor isn't parsable for some reason, will look into.

Usage:
    Execute this script from the "File->Import" menu and choose a m3 file to open.

Notes:
    Generates the standard verts and faces lists.
